This current demo consist of:

- Using the arrow keys or touch screen to move the character around.
- Pressing start will swap between the top and bottom screens.
 
# Build Instructions
I ran this on Windows 10, so assume a mostly typical Windows 10 environment. If you're doing this on Unix, hopefully it works without any major changes. The only thing is that `make images` probably won't work. If you want to tweak the images, you'll need to extract the `grit` commands from the batch files.

Follow the instructions at https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started to install devkitPro. Install it with libnds.

Git clone https://github.com/DeathCamel57/libgl2d_ds and follow the installation instructions.

Using the nflib directory from https://github.com/PolyMarsDev/Snake-DS, which should be a compiled version of Nightfox's Lib.

cd to this directory and run `make` and hope like heck that the build environment works and that it doesn't depend on some obscure Windows 10 thing that I had preinstalled.

# Images

For images, they need to be in Indexed mode (Image > Mode > Indexed Color), and then exported as .bmp (forced into 8bit). Then use the GRIT tool in the
NFLib checkout with Compile_Backgrounds.bat.

This has been simplified to just running `make images`.

# Sounds
To convert sound files to RAW format I used [Switch](http://www.nch.com.au/switch/plus.html) as recommended by NightFox. I exported as Mono, 8 bis signed at 11025hz for sound effects, and 22050hz for background music.
