# libnds-examples

I'd like to test some game development using C/C++ languages and then I tried some code using libnds. It can create simple games for the Nintendo DS.

You can try it first setting up your environment using [this link]. If you have interest, [John Riselvato's NDS Homebrew Development Resource] has a lot of examples to use another DS features. 

After it's done, you can compile your own `.nds` file and test on an emulator or real hardware (I'm also including it)

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/hgvarani/libnds-examples.git $DEVKITPRO/examples/libnds-examples

$ cd $DEVKITPRO/examples/libnds-examples
$ make
```
