# Build Instructions
Follow the instructions at https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started to install devkitPro. Install it with libnds.

Git clone https://github.com/DeathCamel57/libgl2d_ds and follow the installation instructions.

Using the nflib directory from https://github.com/PolyMarsDev/Snake-DS, which should be a compiled version of Nightfox's Lib.

cd to this directory and run `make` and hope like heck that the build environment works and that it doesn't depend on some obscure Windows 10 thing that I had preinstalled.
